                <p>Once upon a time the online gaming population was quite diverse, but everything changed when League of Legends attacked. League of Legends is the online gaming sensation that has swept throughout the nations. This, mostly, free game has been boasting the highest amount of gamers, highest amount of eSports viewers and almost anything in which large numbers are seen as positive(man that was a clumsy sentence). Forunately for me I mostly have to fill up this page so it looks semi decent, content is only secondary. Which is why I have dragged this long-winded reflection as long as I could. League of Legends is set upon the Summoner's Rift in which teams consisting of 5 members battle it out. These members are called champions, and if you search around long enough on the internet you might actually find some kind of lore.</p>

                    <p>The game is recommended for people who aren't turned away from the intense hate that newer players face. Apparently it's hard for a new player, as the veterans of the game can be quite hard on newer players who aren't used to the game. This makes League of Legends a hard game to get into, but it's a ton of fun once you have dragged yourself through the drudge that is 1-30. I will now proceed to end this review.</p>
