IT2805 WEBTEK - Project Architecture Description

We made this page building everything from scratch to better display what we learned during the course. Some people decided to use bootsrap, but we thought that would be a bit wrong.

The webpage consists of several "masterpages" and they have several underpages that has more or less the same theme.

These pages use a HTML template and a main css file that gives consistency to all pages. The pages also have a menu in the top that contains links to all these "masterpages" and the main page.

Major Technologies:

HTML - We used HTML to build the webpage and construct it to our wishes (obviously)

CSS - CSS was used in a way that we have a "main" css file that contains the style that all the pages use. 
When we want some styles that will just be exclusive for one site, we make a tiny css file that only has those special styles for that page.

Javascript - We use javascript on our "server" page. We have an eventlistener on a dropdownlist that changes the pagecontent.

Minor technologies:

HTML-Forms - We thought that it would be good to include forms on our page since it is supposed to be an online community for gamers. When they want to put up/suggest a server, they submit a form through a "register" page.

XML - XML is used for a "FAQ" part under "about us". We figured this was a decent way to display XML on the page. The XML is built into the page and displayed under the "maincontent" section.
